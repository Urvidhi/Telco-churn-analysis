# Telco-churn-analysis
Objective:

The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing on various factors such as payment
methods, contract types, tenure, and demographic attributes. The goal is to identify which
factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer retention
strategies.

Key Insights from the Analysis:

📊 Overall churn rate: 26.54% – meaning nearly 1 in 4 customers left.

 📊 Contract type plays a major role –
 
Month-to-month contracts: Highest churn rate (~45-50%).
1-year contracts: Moderate churn (~10-15%).
2-year contracts: Lowest churn (~5%).
 📊 Senior citizens are more likely to churn (~40%), while younger customers show lower churn rates (~20-25%).
 📊 Customers who use online security, tech support, and streaming services have higher retention rates, while those without these services experience 35-40% churn.

Tech Stack Used:

🛠 Languages: Python

 📚 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

 📌 Project Goal
 
To analyze telecom customer data and identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn. The goal is to build meaningful visualizations that help business stakeholders understand which customer segments are at risk of leaving and why.

❗️Business Problem

Telecom companies face high customer attrition, directly impacting revenue. Without clear insights into why customers churn, it's difficult to take preventive action. This project addresses the need to:
1-Detect key churn indicators.
2-Segment customers based on usage and contract type.
3-Support data-driven retention strategies.

💡 Business Impact

Improved Customer Retention: By identifying key churn drivers (e.g., short tenure, monthly contracts, lack of add-on services), the business can take targeted actions to reduce churn.
1- Informed Decision-Making: Visual insights allow management to prioritize improvements in service areas like tech support and payment experience.
2- Cost Savings: Helps reduce customer acquisition costs by focusing on retaining existing customers.
3- Enhanced Service Personalization: Enables customized offers for at-risk customers based on behavior and service history.
